## **Overview**
Airplane has become a commoditized mode of transportation over the years in the U.S.. Millions of travelers travel across the country and around the globe for both business and leisure.

If you have been one of these travelers, chances are you have been blessed by either a delay or cancellation at least a few times in your life. Being stuck at an airport terminal is a terrible feeling. The seats at the gate are uncomfortable. The wifi can get spotty. A burger causes $15 plus tax, tips, and some tacked on health tax.

In this project, let us pretend to be Tom Hanks, stuck at a terminal with no end in sight. We have all the time in the world, so let's explore some flight data.

## **Questions**
Our main question is whether SFO is the WAAT (worst airport of all time)

To answer that question, we will explore a few key datapoints

1. Popularity
What are the most popular airports in the U.S.?

2. Cancellation
Which airport cancels the most flight?
What are the correlation with other factors?

3. Delay
Can we prove that there is statistical difference between SFO and other airports in flight delays?

## **Data**
Data obtained from the "Airline On-Time Performance Data" database hosted by the US Department of Transportation

The database tracks every non-stop U.S. domestic flights by month and year, by carrier and by origin and destination airport. Includes scheduled and actual departure and arrival times, canceled and diverted flights.
